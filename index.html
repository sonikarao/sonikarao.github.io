I am heavily involved in the Yearbook production at my school, and this year I am serving as the Editor-in-Chief. Along with this, I am involved in the Mock Trial Competitive team, DECA, Destination Imagination, and the Destination Imagination Junior Board on which I have served as Co-Director and Chairman of the DI-me store for the past three years. Aside from school work, I love to jam out to music, talk about politics, drink coffee, tell bad puns, and pet other people's dogs. But the most important thing about me is that I want to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

                  <p>“I am a senior at Liberty High School who is...”</br></br>

The amount of times I retyped this exact phrase in the past week in hope of connecting with corporate attorneys is unbelievable. This week, our goal in ISM was to create a contact list of at least 25 professionals in our field in preparation for informational interviews and more. I was definitely skeptical at first about whether or not I would actually be able to connect with over 25 lawyers and gain their information in hopes of later communication with them. However, as I scoured through LinkedIn looking for attorneys in the DFW metroplex, I not only found an abundance of lawyers willing to connect with me, but also a great variety of specializations within that group of corporate attorneys. This pushed me to begin researching more specializations within corporate law in hopes of finding a topic that interested me the most. I didn’t end up being as successful as I had hoped while doing this simply because, as soon as I began reading about one topic, I found it difficult to pull my attention away long enough to get captured by the next one. I ended up reading over 300 pages worth of research papers and articles over trademark law, corporate finance law, and securities law. Regardless of my interest in this topics, I still intend to do more research to discover what else I may have a passion for. 
</br></br>
My goal for the upcoming week, and year, is to do more in-depth research of specializations offered and continue networking and hopefully further my search for a mentor through informational interviews.

                  <h2>Pursuing Happiness</h2>
                  <p>“Good Afternoon ladies and gentlemen of the jury...” seems to be the main thing people think of when they think of a lawyer. My goal? To change that. 
			</br></br>
To many, being a lawyer seems to be nothing more than being someone that works 80 hour weeks, is always alone, and is extremely rich. To me, being a lawyer seems like the most noble opportunity one could have in this country. At the end of each day, albeit long and difficult, most lawyers can say they’ve helped someone. My dream is to be able to say that at the end of every day. I’m thrilled to say I’ve finally taken my first steps to achieving this dream. This blog is my digital journey to forming a better society focused on equality for all; specifically in an economic sense. 
</br></br>
Everyone says senior year is the easiest year of high school; however, my last first-two-weeks have been much different than I expected. I’ve learned the basics of fitting in in a business environment, something I truly never dreamed of being able to learn during school. In my ISM class, each student had the opportunity to deliver a introduction speech and receive constructive criticism from their peers. Through this, I found ways to improve my communication skills and learn from my peers. Moreover, I learned all about networking and building a digital portfolio. I was taught of the importance of networking and how meeting professionals in your field can lead to gaining new experiences and opportunities. I also had the chance to begin building the digital version of me, as seen through this site. Yet, the most important thing I learned in ISM, so far, wasn’t learning how to reach out to professionals or how to make myself a more confident speaker. It was that regardless of what path you chose to take in life, make sure you’re pursuing happiness. I was able to hear the passion in my classmates as they discussed their goals and the enthusiasm in my teacher’s voice as she reflected on everything she’s done in her professional life. I discovered that, without passion for what I hope to achieve, I’m never going to be truly successful. 
</br></br>
With that being said, I am ecstatic to be venturing onto this journey of seeking out what I’m genuinely zealous about, and I am extremely grateful to have you join me on this ride.

                  <h2>Paper You</h2>
			
                  <p>Your resume is a paper version of yourself. </br></br>

The importance of a professional resume cannot be stressed upon enough. It dictates the way a future mentor or client would view you: not only in your prior responsibilities and achievements, but also in the way you choose to present yourself. This week in ISM, we had the task of designing a rough draft of our resumes. When creating my resume, I realized, not only must it be professional, but it must suit my audience. More importantly, the main thought that kept going through my mind during this process was ‘what do I want my first impression to be?’ At first, it was difficult for me to decide what there was about me that was worth mentioning. Do I tell my future mentors that I am the Editor-in-Chief of my school’s Yearbook this year, or is that information irrelevant and unnecessary to an attorney? After sorting out my strengths and weaknesses, I was able to differentiate what was truly noteworthy about me versus what was inessential to know.</br></br>
Furthermore, I have officially started reaching out to some of my contacts. Honestly, I am nervous about this whole process. The procedure of calling, being transferred, and eventually hung up on is definitely not a fun one, yet I know the results of all these calls and emails will be worth it. I know that there will, without a doubt, be a few rejections along the way; but I’m thrilled to see where it takes me.

                  <h2>Another Form of Identity Theft</h2>
			
                  <p>This past week I had the goal of setting two informational interviews; challenge complete! Needless to say, I am still shocked by the response I was greeted with when reaching out to the amazing professionals  in the field of corporate law. 
</br></br>

I had my very first informational interview this week with Mrs. Jeanette Zimmer from PepsiCo. Normally, informational interviews are supposed to last around 20 to 30 minutes; my interview with Mrs. Zimmer lasted three and a half hours!! After those wonderful 3.5 hours, I am extremely happy to say this is definitely the right field for me. The week before, I had read a research paper over trademark law - Mrs. Zimmer’s sub-speciality - so I knew some information prior to the interview and was able to ask more content specific questions. I’m almost convinced trademark law is the field for me! Mrs. Zimmer was so passionate about her field that I’m not surprised we spoke for so long. I learned that Trademark lawyers deal with almost every aspect of a company, from trademark issues to advertising and marketing issues. One thing that stood out to me the most from the interview was when Mrs. Zimmer described trademark law as “another form of identity theft”. In a weird way, that makes complete sense.
</br></br>
This informational interview was exceptionally encouraging to me. The things Mrs. Zimmer taught me this week reach further than just law. She taught me that I need to put passion into my work, build relationships, and be open to learning of new fields. If I have that, I’ll be set on my path to success. I’m elated to see how my next informational goes and I cannot wait to learn more!

                  <h2>Hectic</h2>
			
                  <p>This past week has been a slow one. 
</br></br>

 I had a few tests and quizzes, but no research interviews. It was a rather relaxed week in ISM and I definitely enjoyed it. Maybe a little too much. However, I did get ahead on a research interview assessment and began learning how to do interview assessments. I know this upcoming week is going to be a crazy one though. Coach Goff, my ISM teacher, warned us about these weeks. It’s one of those weeks where everything that could possibly need your attention does. It’s one of those weeks where you have to complete four projects, take a test in every single class, stop global warming, all while juggling. Now, that might be a slight exaggeration, but the truth is, this upcoming week is hectic.</br></br>
But of course, I have no one to blame for this but myself. It’s a lesson I learn multiple times a month: get ahead whenever you have the chance. Time management is extremely important; especially now, with college app deadlines coming up, classes getting harder, and more interviews being lined up. Nonetheless, having gotten ahead, even just by a little, and having prepared for interviews is going to help me out a lot. I’m thrilled for the upcoming week because I have two interviews scheduled and Business Symposium, which is sure to be an exciting experience.

                  <h2>Alive and Prepared</h2>
			
                  <p>My interviews were a blast. The first research interview I had was with Mrs. Lori Finkelston at RealPage. Mrs. Finkelston is the general legal counsel for RealPage, so she was able to tell me of the numerous jobs a general counsel must handle and taught me plenty about prioritizing and putting out fires before they grew. My second research interview was with Mr. Martin Woodward, an attorney at Stanley Law Group, who specializes in Consumer Law - specifically, class action consumer law. Consumer Law is, for the most part, the exact opposite of Corporate Law, as in Corporate Law you’d work for a corporation, whereas in Consumer Law you defend consumers from corporations. I reached out to Mr. Woodward to learn more about consumer law and see if it was something I was more interested in compared to corporate law. I definitely learned a lot and was thrilled to listen to Mr. Woodward speak about his career with so much passion. The interview truly left me contemplating the field I chose to study for a while; however, as I did more research, though I admire consumer lawyers everywhere and am fascinated by their job, I can not picture myself as a consumer lawyer. Regardless, I feel as though I learned a lot.
</br></br>
		    
Business Symposium was a great experience. I had the opportunity to sit down and interview two professionals, both extremely passionate and helpful, as well talk to a wide array of professionals during a rotation of networking. At the end of one of my mock interviews, the interviewee told me that, looking at my resume compared to others and having heard the passion in my voice as we communicated, I was the first one he would hire. Those simple words stuck with me for the rest of the week, as I pushed myself to put my best foot forward and put 110% into everything I did. It proved to me that hard work always pays off. With that being said, I’m excited for what next week will bring me and I will continue to work hard and make sure I stay on top of things.

                  <h2>Time Management!!</h2>
			
                  <p>This week in ISM, I have truly learned the meaning of time management. </br></br>
Along with continued attempts reaching out to professionals, I had to submit my first ever interview assessment and another research assessment. On top of these, I had to complete all my work in other classes, the first yearbook deadline of the year, college applications, and going to my job straight after school some days and all weekend. However, this isn’t meant to be seen as a complaint! Though it is difficult, I’m learning time management and how to balance everything out. Luckily, I had begun my interview assessment early and had researched different topics throughout the week for my research interview. Now, I feel more prepared for college as I’m required to keep on top of things by myself without constant reminders from my parents or teachers. As I have learned from my interviews, prioritizing is an essential trait of all attorneys — as there will always be issues that need attention, with everyone believing their’s to be the most important — therefore I am grateful for the opportunity to be learning how to do so at this age.</br></br>
Furthermore, I’ve learned to be flexible. One of my informational interviews had gotten cancelled, however, I was able to reschedule it within an hour of hearing about the issue. Being on top of my work, being flexible, and keeping an optimistic mindset have aided me in gaining opportunities to interact with so many professionals. On that note, I’m excited to see what this week brings me and how it helps me grow!
