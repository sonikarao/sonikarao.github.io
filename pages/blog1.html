    “Good Afternoon ladies and gentlemen of the jury...” seems to be the main thing people think of when they think of a lawyer. My goal? To change that. </br></br>

To many, being a lawyer seems to be nothing more than being someone that works 80 hour weeks, is always alone, and is extremely rich. To me, being a lawyer seems like the most noble opportunity one could have in this country. At the end of each day, albeit long and difficult, most lawyers can say they’ve helped someone. My dream is to be able to say that at the end of every day. I’m thrilled to say I’ve finally taken my first steps to achieving this dream. This blog is my digital journey to forming a better society focused on equality for all; specifically in an economic sense. </br></br>

Everyone says senior year is the easiest year of high school; however, my last first-two-weeks have been much different than I expected. I’ve learned the basics of fitting in in a business environment, something I truly never dreamed of being able to learn during school. In my ISM class, each student had the opportunity to deliver a introduction speech and receive constructive criticism from their peers. Through this, I found ways to improve my communication skills and learn from my peers. Moreover, I learned all about networking and building a digital portfolio. I was taught of the importance of networking and how meeting professionals in your field can lead to gaining new experiences and opportunities. I also had the chance to begin building the digital version of me, as seen through this site. Yet, the most important thing I learned in ISM, so far, wasn’t learning how to reach out to professionals or how to make myself a more confident speaker. It was that regardless of what path you chose to take in life, make sure you’re pursuing happiness. I was able to hear the passion in my classmates as they discussed their goals and the enthusiasm in my teacher’s voice as she reflected on everything she’s done in her professional life. I discovered that, without passion for what I hope to achieve, I’m never going to be truly successful. </br></br> 

With that being said, I am ecstatic to be venturing onto this journey of seeking out what I’m genuinely zealous about, and I am extremely grateful to have you join me on this ride.
